## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the app.

- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Provides the weather data (free API key required).

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started with this project, you can clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RaviSingh733/WeatherApp.git

```
```cd
cd WeatherApp
```
### Get an OpenWeatherMap API Key
- Sign up on OpenWeatherMap and get your free API key.
- Once you have the key, replace YOUR_API_KEY in the script.js file with your actual API key:
- const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY'; // Replace with your OpenWeatherMap API key
  
### Open the App Locally
- After cloning the repo, open the index.html file in your browser.
- This will launch the weather app locally, and you can start searching for cities to view the weather.
- Alternatively, you can deploy the app on GitHub Pages (or another hosting platform) by following the instructions below.

### How to Deploy on GitHub Pages
- Push the project to your GitHub repository if you haven't already.
- Navigate to the repository settings.
- Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
- Under "Source", select the branch you want to deploy (usually main or master).
- After a few minutes, your weather app will be available at https://github.com/RaviSingh733/WeatherApp.git

 ### How the App Works
- User Input: The user enters a city name into the input field.
- API Request: Upon submitting, the JavaScript fetch() function sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the city name and the API key.
- Weather Data: The API returns the current weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed), which is then displayed on the page.
- Error Handling: If the city is not found, the user will see an error message.
